  <h1>ARTIST STATEMENT</h1>
  <p>
    &emsp;<strong>Dareos Khalili (b.1991)</strong> is a greekiranian artist and filmmaker member of the Berlin based art collective <a id="b3" href="https://www.instagram.com/below_three/"><em>Below_Three<3</em></a>. After studying Fine Art Photography in Greece, and Film Directing in the UK and the Czech Republic, he settled in Berlin, Germany where he now lives and works.
  </p>
  <p>
    &emsp;Dareos uses computational photography to collect images that he then pushes to their technical limits and composites into narrative-heavy tableaus. He goes on to exploit generative machine learning tools originally developed to improve visual imperfections in order to add layers of abstraction to his compositions.
  </p>
  <p>
    &emsp;His technique started as a necessity that developed into a conscious aesthetic choice; while respecting restrictions around image-taking on the techno dancefloor but craving to document his experience of togetherness and interconnectivity, using his phone’s camera was the only way in. The process revealed the potential of experimenting with computational photography’s algorithms and helped achieve his neo-expressionist aesthetic. His approach is an attempt to embrace the type of digital noise that followed the rise of phone cameras, as a curious case of a global ‘visual bond’, that has rapidly become a common signifier for most of the western world. A similar approach is observed in his recent portraiture work, where he tricks an applied machine learning algorithm in order to generate parts of the composition and abstract others.
  </p>
  <p>
    &emsp;Dareos’ images invite the viewer inside a story world, challenging them to project their own experience in order to fill-in the piece’s narrative. His subject matter, however, is uniformal; human interconnectivity and the longing for intimacy. In his directorial work he takes a step further towards examining the absurdity of human conventions, and the role they play in one’s need to belong. In his kafkaesque short films -Mr Null (2017) and Lyceum, 2021)- we follow characters stealing component’s of other people’s personalities in order to construct their own, and others struggling to keep power structures functioning, even when their reason for existing has vanished.
